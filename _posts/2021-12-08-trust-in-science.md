The *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/science/scientist-trust-poll.html) late last month on new data from a [Wellcome/Gallup poll](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor-covid-19/2020). The headline finding was that "trust in science and scientists increased globally" between 2018 and 2020. The report notes that trust in science is correlated with knowing about science and speculates that the change in public attitudes was due to media coverage during the pandemic that brought people closer to scientists and scientific research.

That knowing about science correlates with trust in science doesn't surprise me. Knowing, liking, and trusting are all closely related constructs. Further, the more you know, the less you have to trust: with total ignorance, trust is unwarranted, and with perfect knowledge, trust is unnecessary.

What did surprise me about the report and the article was how the authors all took it for granted how low trust in science is overall. Even in 2020, after trust had risen, less than half of respondents said they trusted science a lot.

Obviously, scientists are only human and prone to the same kinds of mistakes and misbehavior as anyone else, but there are lots of reasons to trust science as a whole. Where is the gap between the rigor and expertise in scientific practice and trust in science by the public?
