title: Should Covid treatments make risky behaviors more attractive?

*The New York Times* is reporting today that Pfizer's new oral, antiviral drug, 'Paxlovid', was [found to be effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/health/pfizer-covid-pill-paxlovid.html) against both severe infections and the Omicron variant. These findings considerably strengthen the company's application for FDA authorization and mean that Americans may be able to use the treatment within weeks.

Although it will not bring about the end of the pandemic, Paxlovid (and a similar drug developed by Merck) is likely to save many lives and reduce the severity of illness for many patients. As with previous positive developments in the course of the pandemic, this news should allow us all to breathe a small sigh of relief.

Yet, at the same time, Covid cases are rapidly rising for the first time since the Delta surge in July, probably due to relaxed public health measures, waning immunity from vaccines, and holiday travel. Community spread of the Omicron variant is becoming significant and seems likely to produce an additional surge within weeks, too. Consequently, public health officials are begging people to redouble their use of masks, vaccines, and social distancing behaviors.

Assuming Paxlovid, or any other antiviral drug effective against Covid, comes to market soon, and knowing we are at the beginning of a surge, we face a choice about how to modify our behavior.

On the one hand, it's rational to say that, with effective antiviral drugs readily available, we should stop worrying so much about contracting or communicating Covid. If you get sick, it's no big deal. Take a pill and you'll be fine. If that's the worst-case scenario, why bother taking any precautions?

On the other hand, even the most potent post-infection treatment demands a difficult leap-of-faith. Unlike vaccines, which *prevent* an infection, antiviral drugs merely treat them. If a vaccine is like an airplane, an antiviral drug is like a parachute. Sure, you can see why *someone* would be willing to jump, but are you willing to?

My point is that, even if antiviral drugs turn out to be *more* effective than vaccines in preventing disease, they demand a different kind of mental accounting. We may find that while the drugs work, in the sense that they treat infections, they won't motivate the kind of behavior change in risk-averse individuals that they rationally should.
