The lead research article of the most recent issue of *Science* is ["Community policing does not build citizen trust in police or reduce crime in the Global South"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd3446).

The research was a collaboration of 27 researchers in five countries to run a large-scale field experiment across South America, Africa, and Asia. When these studies are published, it's a big deal, if for no other reason than the difficulty and cost of executing a study of this scale.

Because high-quality empirical research is necessarily so scarce, these large-scale field experiments carry a lot of weight with policy wonks, and, one hopes, policymakers. When arguing for or against a community policing program, someone, somewhere, is going to cite this article.

On its face, that's not really a problem. But they're going to cite the article without actually reading it. It's almost inevitable. Scientific articles are long, dense, highly technical, and, frankly, a bit repetitive.

That's why it's so important to get the headline right. 

And why I'm frustrated that this one is misleading.

It's not wrong, *per se*. But "Community policing does not build citizen trust in police or reduce crime in the Global South" implies a certain pair of relationships that the study doesn't even really analyze:

1. Enacting community policing behaviors does not lead to higher levels of citizen trust in police.
1. Enacting community policing behaviors does not reduce crime.

In these propositions, I have made explicit what the title implies the independent variable in the study is. But community policing itself is not the actual independent variable in the study.

Instead, the study looked at police reforms *intended* to lead to community policing and found that they did not succeed in doing so: "The police implemented the interventions unevenly and incompletely...[and] we have limited evidence of police action in response to citizen reports."

From a citizen's perspective, then, not much changed. It's little wonder that no meaningful change in police behavior led to no meaningful change in outcomes. Ultimately, this is less a story about community policing and more about the general difficulty of organizational change.
