In the debate about how artificial intelligence (AI) affects employment and productivity, the two sides argue something like the following:

1. Eventually, machines will be able to do everything a human can do, and they'll do it better, faster, and more cheaply.
1. Machines will never replace human workers, only enhance their productivity by serving as advanced tools.

Whether you qualify each claim as optimistic or pessimistic depends on what you value, and let's put values aside for the moment. Yet it remains a worthwhile question to ask, who's right? Does the continued development and application of AI mean that machines will replace humans, or that humans will be able to do things they never could before?

Davies *et al.*'s recent article in *Nature*, ["Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x) presents several cases in pure math where researchers used AI to solve important problems that the brightest mathemeticians had yet to solve on their own.

With AI, mathemticians sort of have a sounding board for their intuitions&mdash;they can model the relationships between purely conceptual mathematical objects and see what kinds of patterns emerge. This role for AI places it somewhere above a tool; there are social and cognitive components of AI's role in pure math research that make it more like a collaborator. But it's still far less than an independent researcher.

Personally, I think this is an excellent role for AI: increasing productivity and supporting research by augmenting human capabilities. With research getting more difficult, funding getting scarcer, and global problems requiring a faster pace of innovation, I am excited to see how else AI can help researchers do their jobs better.
