    <p>The lead research article of the most recent issue of <em>Science</em> is <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd3446">“Community policing does not build citizen trust in police or reduce crime in the Global South”</a>.</p>

<p>The research was a collaboration of 27 researchers in five countries to run a large-scale field experiment across South America, Africa, and Asia. When these studies are published, it’s a big deal, if for no other reason than the difficulty and cost of executing a study of this scale.</p>

<p>Because high-quality empirical research is necessarily so scarce, these large-scale field experiments carry a lot of weight with policy wonks, and, one hopes, policymakers. When arguing for or against a community policing program, someone, somewhere, is going to cite this article.</p>

<p>On its face, that’s not really a problem. But they’re going to cite the article without actually reading it. It’s almost inevitable. Scientific articles are long, dense, highly technical, and, frankly, a bit repetitive.</p>

<p>That’s why it’s so important to get the headline right.</p>

<p>And why I’m frustrated that this one is misleading.</p>

<p>It’s not wrong, <em>per se</em>. But “Community policing does not build citizen trust in police or reduce crime in the Global South” implies a certain pair of relationships that the study doesn’t even really analyze:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enacting community policing behaviors does not lead to higher levels of citizen trust in police.</li>
  <li>Enacting community policing behaviors does not reduce crime.</li>
</ol>

<p>In these propositions, I have made explicit what the title implies the independent variable in the study is. But community policing itself is not the actual independent variable in the study.</p>

<p>Instead, the study looked at police reforms <em>intended</em> to lead to community policing and found that they did not succeed in doing so: “The police implemented the interventions unevenly and incompletely…[and] we have limited evidence of police action in response to citizen reports.”</p>

<p>From a citizen’s perspective, then, not much changed. It’s little wonder that no meaningful change in police behavior led to no meaningful change in outcomes. Ultimately, this is less a story about community policing and more about the general difficulty of organizational change.</p>
